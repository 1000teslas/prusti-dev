Verified Rosetta Code Examples
==============================

This folder contains the examples from Rosetta Code we verified with
Prusti. Each example is split between two fails: the original Rust file
``*.rs.orig`` and the verified version ``*.rs``. For example, the
original version of the binary search example can be found in file
``Binary_search.rs.orig`` and the verified version in file
``Binary_search.rs``. Each ``*.rs`` file has a comment that explains
from where exactly the example was taken and lists the changes made to
the example, as well as the verified properties.
