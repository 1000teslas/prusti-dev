Using Prusti
============

Virtual Machine
===============

The ZIP file contains a VirtualBox image with Ubuntu that has Prusti
installed as a command line tool. To start the virtual machine follow
these steps:

1.  Download and install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/.
2.  Extract the ZIP archive.
3.  Start VirtualBox.
4.  Choose “File” → “Import VM…”
5.  Select the extracted “Prusti.ova” file and follow the instructions.
6.  If the import was successful, there should “Prusti” in the list of
    virtual machines. Select it and click “Start”.

The user is called “prusti” and its password is also “prusti”.

Trying Examples
===============

On the desktop there should be a folder called “Prusti Examples”. For
each example we verified, it contains two files: the original Rust file
``*.rs.orig`` and the verified version ``*.rs``. Each ``*.rs`` file has
a comment that explains from where exactly the example was taken and
lists the changes made to the example and the verified properties.
You can run Prusti on an example as follows:

1.  Open the terminal.
2.  Change the current directory to the examples directory:

        cd "Desktop/Prusti Examples"

3.  Run Prusti on a chosen example:

        prusti borrow_first.rs

4.  Prusti should print “Successful verification of 3 items”.
5.  You can enable overflow checks by setting the environment variable
    PRUSTI_CHECK_BINARY_OPERATIONS to ``true``::

        PRUSTI_CHECK_BINARY_OPERATIONS=true prusti Heapsort.rs

6.  Similarly, you can disable the panic checks by setting
    PRUSTI_CHECK_PANICS to ``false``.
