# Verification Features

When a Rust file is verified with Prusti, it can verify the following:

- [Absence of panics](panic.md)
- [Overflow checks](overflow.md)
- [Pre- and postconditions](prepost.md)
- [Trusted functions](trusted.md)
- [Pure functions](pure.md)
- [External specifications](external.md)
- [Loop body invariants](loop.md)
- [Pledges](pledge.md)
- [Trait contract refinement](traits.md)
- [Closures](closure.md)
- [Specification entailments](spec_ent.md)

By default, only absence of panics is checked. See each section for usage of the additional verification features.
