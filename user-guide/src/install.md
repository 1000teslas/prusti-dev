# Installation

## Prusti Assistant

The easiest way to try out Prusti is by using the ["Prusti Assistant"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=viper-admin.prusti-assistant) extension for VS Code. Please follow the instruction on the extension page if you wish to use this method.

The rest of this guide describes Prusti syntax that is currently only available in the "nightly" build channel. The setting is found in `File → Preferences → Settings → Prusti Assistant → Build Channel`.

## Command-line setup

Alternatively, Prusti can be set up by downloading the [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev/releases) available from the project page. There are binaries for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu. Releases marked as "Pre-release" may contain unstable or experimental features.

For a command-line setup with Prusti built from source, please follow the [developer guide](https://viperproject.github.io/prusti-dev/dev-guide/development/setup.html).
